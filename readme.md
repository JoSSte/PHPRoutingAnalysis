# What is it, precious?
This is a test to see if a single routing file is more effective than a webserver based config like apache's mod_rewrite and .htaccess

# Why?
I read [an article about routing in PHP](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-routing-system-in-php/) and considered whether gathering everything in  one file (which would simplify the redirects) uses more or less resources than a couple of diffferent files doing the dispatching.
